# html-farewellCard

##This is just a first try to explore HTML and it's basic functions.

**The idea of this project:** create a nice farewell card for my teammates after our work together had been finished.
At the same time, this project allowed me to get know about HTML, CSS and how HTML and CSS work together.

_ _This project does not require installation of any additional tools._ _
